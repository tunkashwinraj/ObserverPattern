# ObserverPattern
The Observer Pattern is a design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency relationship between objects. When the state of a subject (e.g., stock price) changes, all its observers (subscribers) are automatically notified and updated. This pattern is useful for implementing systems like notifications, stock tracking, and event handling.
